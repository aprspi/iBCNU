# iBCNU (APRS on iOS)

Once a very popular now almost obsolete APRS application for the iOS platform, iBCNU during its hayday had a cult following of thousands of ham radio enthusiasts from around the world. I never had time to keep it updated and thus if any of you want to take a look at the source code or even resurect this from the dead, feel free to do so.
